Atari 8bit Freddy and DRAM chips replacement.
---------------------------------------------

I created it because I had 32k SRAM chips available and needed to test if my Freddy is working (it was).

There are more reasonable Freddy and SRAM replacements avialble:

Pre-built:
- https://retrolemon.co.uk/atari-8bit-upgrades/81-freddie-module.html
- https://lotharek.pl/productdetail.php?id=233
- https://retrolemon.co.uk/atari-8bit-upgrades/114-sram-64kb.html
- https://lotharek.pl/productdetail.php?id=291

What's left from Freddy is then just frequency /4 divider you can do on 7474.
